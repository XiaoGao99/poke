### CMA OA Project
1. What is the URL to your GitHub-Pages site?
2. What API did you use and why?
- I used Pokemon API because I like Pokemon series.
3. What are some other applications for your API other than searching? Name a few and describe how an app using it for that purpose might work.
- It's a simple Pokemon dictionary, it shows basic Pokemon stats. 
4. Explain the considerations you needed to make for the website to be responsive & mobile-friendly.
- I need to consider both layout, the horizontal layout for PC and the vertical layout for mobile.
5. How can you make your app accessible to people with disabilities such as blindness or colorblindness?
- I used limited colors on this project, baically just plain white.
6. If you could make further changes to your project to improve/expand the experience, what would they be and how would you go about implementing them?
- I would add more routes to the dictionary, like when the user clicks the pokemon, the site will direct to a detailed page. The user can view things like where to encounter this Pokemon, the ablities of this Pokemon, and etc.s
